            <p>Halo 2 is the second game in the Halo series, and a direct sequel to Halo: Combat Evolved.  After successfully destroying halo, the master chief has returned to Earth, along with most of the surviving human forces.  Their celebration is short lived however, as earth is soon attacked by a huge fleet of alien ships.  The player once again plays as the master chief in a last ditch defense of earth.  Upon release, Halo 2 quickly became the most popular game on Xbox (and remained so for the next 2 years) with over 6.3 million copies sold in the US.  Improving on the first game in almost every way, Halo 2 won numerous awards only recieving significant criticism for its cliffhanger ending.</p>
