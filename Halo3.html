                    <p>Possibly the most hyped game of all time, Halo 3 delivers the epic conclusion to the Halo Trilogy.  Despite all odds, humanity lead by the master chief has managed to hang on to the war torn battlefield that is earth.  Upon discovering an ancient artifact that can fire all of the halo rings at once and destroy all life in the galaxy, the player has to destroy the artifact and once again prevent the destruction of all life in the galaxy.  Upon release, Halo 3 set the record for the highest grossing first day sales, making 170 million dollars in the US within 24 hours, breaking the previous record held by Halo 2.   Most critics agreed that the story lived up to the hype, and that the multiplayer was phenomenal.  Despite its age and newer games coming out in the series, halo 3 still has a sizeable multiplayer community.  Along with the previous 2 games, Halo 3 further popularized video game culture and turned Halo into a cultural icon.</p>
