            <p>Halo: Combat evolved is the first game in the Halo series.  Released by Bungie in 2001 after a rocky production, Halo CE was intended to be a system seller for the brand new Xbox.  Despite its rocky development, it recieved unanimous praise for its huge, open levels, its smooth gameplay, and amazing storytelling.  The story opens with the player taking control of the master chief, and battling various aliens to uncover the secrets of the mysterious ringworld halo.   Upon realizing that halo is a weapon, and that a group of aliens intends to use it to destroy humanity, Master Chief races against time to regroup with other humans and destroy halo before its too late. </p>
