Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I wasn't super sure what I wanted to make my website about, so I started writing about the first thing that came to my mind, which was the games which the
music I was listening to was from.

Files:
All pages have a header which consists of an unordered list with fancy styling, linking all 4 pages together, as well as a footer, with a quote from the halo game its describing (except for the first page).  This
quote is media sensitive and will change if the viewport is small enough.

All pages also have a main picture from the respective game and a brief description of that game.

The home page (index.html) also has a couple thumbnails that link to trailers for the 3 games below the main text blurb (bootstrap component).  Beneath that is
table that uses bootstraps styling to make a visually appealing table that lists the games and their release dates.

Stylesheet.css is the css stylesheet that contains the css for the website.  Stylesheet.scss is the sass version.

All of the .jpg files are the relevant photos used on the website.
